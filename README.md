# The Journal App - MERN

This project allows users to create journal entries daily to share their thoughts and feelings. Groq's LLM API generates a title and summary for the user (if they wish). The user can upload a pdf instead if they prefer (in case they rather write their entry out) and store it online. This project utilizes MongoDB to store all the user data, React for the front end, and Node and Express for the backend. It also used JWT to create a login/signup function for various users to use this application.
